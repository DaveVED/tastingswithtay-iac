# Creats the core common networking components for https://tastingswithtays.com
#
# Using this networking.yaml temaplte, you will get a VPC configuration with the following setup.
#    1. A VPC with VPC Flow Logs setup. CIDR block is hardcoded, not an input parameter.
#    2. A set of two subents to be public facing. CIDR blocks are hardcoded, not an input parameter.
#    3. A set of two subents to be privaate facing. CIDR blocks are hardcoded, not an input paramter.
#    4. An Internet Gateway to send egress traffic, as needed.
#    5. An Nat Gateway, to allow the private subents to reach out to the world wide web.
#    6. Route Table configurations for your subent mappings.
#    7. Raw set of VPCE for ECR, s3, and Lambda.
#    8. ACM to be used with preexisting Public Hosted Zone in Route53.
#
# The CI for this IaC stores teh stacks in s3, then wraps them all in the foundation.yaml parent, this way we
# can use common components, but only deploy one stack, removing the complex need for custom buildspec.yaml,
# but instead allow us to use one CodeDeploy.
